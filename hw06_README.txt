--------------------INITIATION------------
It will take the program around 1 minute to generate the whole game tree and another 5 seconds to score all the nodes. Then the game can start.

-------------------GAME DEFAULT------------
At the beginning of each new game, the user will be asked to choose whether to play 'x' or 'o'
Note that x' always goes first, which means if the user chooses to play 'o', the program agent will go first.

------------------INTERACITON--------------
The user need to type in two numbers to indicate where to make the next move. For example, type 2,2 to make a move at row 2 column 2(center of the board)

The user can stop the current game or the entire program by pressing q whenever they are asked to type something.
